<blockquote>
When Bob and I got done with our last film, I said "You know, I think we should slow down with the 'On the Road' series. Your nose is getting too long, and I'd rather golf. Golf and sing."<p>  
Bob said, "You're right, Bing, my nose could sure use the rest."<p>  
"Hey Bob," I said.<p>  
"What?" he replied.<p>  
"What's a crooner?"<p>  
"A crooner?"<p>  
"Yah, a crooner."<p>  
"Why?"<p>  
"Well, somebody called me one the other day, and I thought about smackin' him, but then I wasn't sure."<p>  
"Hmm. How'd he say it?"<p>  
"I was walking down the street, doing that babababoo thing I do, and this guy comes up to me and says 'Can I have an autograph, Mr. Crosby? You're a real crooner.'"<p>  
"Hmm.  Do you give him one?"<p>  
"One what?"<p>  
"An autograph."<p>
"Well, yah, I had this autograph of Mae West...'"<p>  
"Hmm. Even though he called you a crooner?"<p>  
"Well, yah. I wasn't sure."<p>  
"What's the worst 'crooner' could mean?"<p>  
"I don't know, a man who wears one of those sandwich boards that says Eat a Lot of Meat, maybe someone who likes galoshes, it could mean anything."<p>  
"Yah..." Bob shook his head, and I contemplated that. Was he thinking 'how pathetic', or was he just trying to shake his nose off his head?<p>  
"Say Bob, what do you think I should have done?"<p>  
"I don't know, Bing, but I need a decongestant."<p>  
"On which game show?"<p>  
"Never mind, Bing. Go golf. It makes you croon."<p>  
"Thanks Bob," I said, somewhat consoled. "I love to croon."<p>
