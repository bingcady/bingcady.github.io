<blockquote>
Have you ever felt awash in a sea of uncertainty, hopelessly lost in the Ideological Haystack? Well, there was a guy I knew who could help.
<p>
He was my Uncle Lou. He may never have headed Sears Roebuck or killed the President, but he knew things too. Let Lou tell you the secrets of an old ice carver, and save yourself years of chipping away at frozen water.
