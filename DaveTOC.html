<h1>Dear Dave:<br>
Oh, Nothing.</h1>
<h3>the letters I never sent 
<br>
to David Letterman</h3>

Dave Letterman is a pretty popular guy these days, more so even than when I wrote this book three years ago. 
<p>
The book is an account of my mission to send Dave countless letters for his mailbag, letters I assumed would be read on his show, letters which would endear me to Dave, his family and perhaps even that woman who breaks into his house. 
<p>
Join me in my quest for the coveted "Friend of Dave" grail; you might learn some valuable lessons. I know I have.
