<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR="6666CC">I</FONT><FONT SIZE=5>t was a beautiful day for a ball game, but Sarah was busy. There was the lawn, laid out in classic Sumerian worship format -- the trees were even planted upside down. But something wasn't right, and Sarah had stood there staring at the lawn all day, wondering what it was. 
<P>
"oh my god, that's it" she finally sighed. Sarah wandered over to the welcome mat, flipped it upside down, and spray-painted onto it the magical phrase: GO 
BRUINS. She stepped back. 
<P>
"there." 
<P>
The sky opened up, a blinding light shot down, and the house was instantly clad in a meadowlark blue aluminum siding, completely ensconcing the ugly old stucco which clung to the house like Miracle Whip&#153;. 
<P>
"thanks," Sarah said to the sky, and flipped over the mat.
<P>
"That's a pretty neat trick," said a passing olive manufacturer. "I don't suppose you have any spells for brainstorming ideas?"
<P>
"i don't really do spells," 
answered Sarah. "the sumerians owed me a favor. what kind of idea do you need?"
<P>
"You remember pimentos?"
<P>
"yah?"
<P>
"I invented that. Pimentos in the olive."
<P>
"by the way, what are pimentos?"
<P>
"I'm not sure. They're red. Red and green are complimentary colors."
<P>
"ah." said Sarah.
<P>
"I've run out of pimentos finally, and I wouldn't know where to get more. What I need is something new to put into my olives, something exciting."
<P>
"why don't you try small car parts."
<P>
"Such as?"
<P>
"ball bearings, dashboard leds, you name it. people always need car parts."
<P>
"So it's like Crackerjack?"
<P>
"exactly."
<P>
"You're something, Sarah," said the manufacturer, and whistled offstage.
