<P>
"manufacturer," called Sarah. "manufacturer."
<P>
"Yes?" answered the olive man, anticipating a problem with the shoes.
 "I heard you slapping down the street. What's wrong?"
<P>
"they made my feet into pans, not the casters" sobbed Sarah.
<P>
"Oh, thank god," breathed the olive man. "I thought the soles had come unglued." The two sat down and made drawings of the revised pan-shaped design, and an hour later, Sarah tried on her new shoes. 
<P>
"they're beautiful," admired Sarah, "and they muffle the slapping so well."
 <P>
"That's the taupe," confided the olive man. "It's such a versatile color."
<P>
Sarah smiled radiantly, but just then her smile turned to concern. 
<P>
"however will i pay you for these lovely shoes?" 
<P>
"Have you got any ideas for that hollow space in cantaloupe?"
<P>
Sarah smiled, slapped her way quietly over to the worried produce man, and whispered: 
"got any olives?" 
<P>
Then she went home, to watch some TV.
