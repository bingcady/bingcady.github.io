"It's good to see you, Beth."<p>
"Nice to see you, Max."<p>
"How long has it been?"<p>
"What do you mean?"<p>
"How long has it been since we've seen each other?"<p>
"About three days. Why?"<p>
"So the sun's gone up and down three times since then."<p>
"Uh-huh."<p>
"Where've you been?"<p>
"Standing right over there."<p>
"Really? For the whole three days?"<p>
"Yes, Max. I was lost, and they tell you if you're lost to stay there and your mother will find you."<p>
"But that only applies to department stores, Beth."<p>
"Really?"<p>
"Well, did it work? Did she find you?"<p>
"Of course not, Max. My mother lives in a hut, with eskimos. New Mexico somewhere."<p>
"But still..."<p>
"Why are you bothering me, Max?"<p>
All right. If you must know, I'm trying to set the world record."<p>
"Really? How many do you have left to go?"<p>
"Three."<p>
"Oh, you're kidding."<p>
"I'm not, Beth. Two and a half more, and I'm a rich man."<p>
"Well, what can I do to help, Max?"<p>
"Well, if you really want to help. Crack those 6 nuts and scream into this jar."<p>
[cracking, cracking, and a glass-muted wail ensues.]<p>
"Now what, Max?"<p>
"OK. Now go stand over there."<p>
"OK."<p>
[three days pass]<p>
"It's good to see you, Beth."<p>
"Nice to see you, Max..."
