<p>
<b>First disclaimer:</b> I am a BIG Dave fan, and though I did publish this book in print form, I never intended to make money from it. I just wanted to get it out on the airwaves and hear people's opinions on it; now that the web is here and free and available to a much larger audience, I'm happy to make it available free here instead (I'm afraid I'm just not a capitalist). And yes, I did write to Dave and the show well beforehand for permission to publish. So read it and let me know what you think!
<p>
I would like to thank my friends for their help and support of me and for their genuine concern over the civil unrest in Indiana: Amy Verhelst, Beth Penrod, Jenny Carr, Mark Alderete, and Sandy Potter.
