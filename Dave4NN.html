<h2>Phase II: Dave and I Are Pals</h2>

When you get to know a guy a little bit, I think you start to lose the macho male persona somewhat, and you can be yourself. By the twelfth letter, I felt that I knew Dave at least well enough to wash his car, or date his daughter. Therefore, I began to loosen up.
<p>
Although I had never called him "Mr. Letterman sir", I decided to stop doing that. I opted instead for the simpler "Dave" or "Dave" or "Mr. Problem Hair sir". I also made the decision at this point to let my sideburns grow in, because it looks so good on Bruce Springsteen (this had nothing to do with Dave, I was just saying). 
<p>
Another change came about for me at this time. I think you can tell from my tone in the next few letters that the nervousness that had caused my sweaty palms to drop my pen and ruin several pairs of dress slacks was pretty well gone. I was no longer stuttering, and I felt more self-confident. I recall having had much the same feeling when in sixth grade, we all began wearing cups in gym. However, I do not now wear a cup. At any rate, I think Dave started feeling more comfortable with me too, or would have if I had sent him any of the previous letters.

     Dear Dave:

     I'm too tired to write anything today.
     I hope this will do.

                    Blah blah,
                    John Cady

     Dear Dave:

     Does David Sanborn have a job, or at
     least a place to stay?

                    Concerned,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI

     Dave:

     I've been trying for months to date      
     Teri Garr, but she ignores my telepathy.
     Next time she's on your show, could 
     you ask her for me? I'm 4'1" tall with
     hair and five teeth. I like to hide inside 
     things and eat styrofoam cups, and I 
     ski. If Teri comes over to my place, we 
     could order chinese and watch <i>Bolero</i>,
     and then race around the apartment
     screaming and running from things 
     that aren't scary.

                    You're a pal,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI

<b>At times, I took to stretching the truth a bit to keep things interesting. This one was really out there - I've never skied in my life!</b>
<p>

<p>

     Dave:

     In answer to your letter of July 23, 
     requesting my height, I am 5'8" tall.
     Some people would consider this short, 
     but often it's because they're taller.

     I appreciate your concern for my 
     stature, and would like to ask your 
     calf width.

                    Cordially,
                    John Cady

     Dear Dave:

     I'm confused. Are chef Paul Prudhomme
     and actor/comedian Dom DeLuise at all
     related? I know the Landers sisters are.

                    Interested,
                    John Cady

     Dave:

     You know, I don't believe in the adage
     "leave your work at work". If you were 
     a dishwasher and you followed that,
     your house would look like hell.

                    Yours Truly,
                    John Cady

<b>Social consciousness has always been my middle name (not literally). Prior to this point, I had refrained from trying to educate Dave's viewers. I couldn't help but preach a little, just this once.</b>
<p>
<pre>
     Dear Dave:

     I'd like to give a piece of advice to some 
     of your viewers out there. I know a lot
     of you are younger, and being "cool" is a 
     part of being young. But if you think you 
     are being cool by running naked into a
     buzz saw, you're not. Stop it.

                    Yours Truly,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI

     PS: I was thinking of something the other
           night. Dave, have you ever thought 
           that your popularity arose <i>despite</i>
           your hairstyle?

     Dear Dave:

     I can put a penny in my nose and leave it 
     there. Please don't ask me to the studio;
     I have no need to show off. I just wanted
     you to know.

                    Sincerely,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI
