Here's the <a href="http://www.audioweb.com/">AudioWeb</a> site.
<br>
In it is a list of <a href="http://www.audioweb.com/directory/links/index.html">audio sites</a>
<br>
and also in one of the magazines listed in their newstand, there's an <a href="http://www.audioweb.com/newsstand/AudioAmateur/25-4/index.html">article on jitter</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://www.panix.com/~bobkatz/">Digital Domain</a> has a site.

<p>
<a href="http://www.apogeedigital.com/">Apogee's</a> site is really ugly.

The main site to get you going in the right direction will probably be that AudioWeb list of audio-related sites. It includes a link to the <a href="http://www.openmusic.com/omn/global/woa.html">World of Audio</a> site and the <a href="http://soundwave.com/">Soundwave</a> site, which look like they might have some stuff. The Audio FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) list on the AudioWeb list might have some good info too. It's just a bunch of text documents, but the FAQs are usually well-informed.
<p>
I got a lot from Lycos by searching on "professional audio products" and "professional digital audio".
<p>
Also, WebCrawler gave me a really succinctly organized list of sites when I searched with "professional digital audio products">
