Here are some of my favorite sites on the Web. If they're your favorites too, hit your exclamation point key three times, and wherever I am, I'll hear.<p>

<ul>

<li>My friend Paul has a visual zen garden of a <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~grocho/">website</a>. Caution: peruse and lose yourself in a place far from the worldly cares that aggravate me every $#@! day. If you find yourself unable, or unwilling - to leave it - that's not my fault. Paul's over in Milan.</li>

<A HREF = "http://www.umich.edu/~verhelst/">Amy Verhelst</A> tops the list, with a page of renderings of a dog and several lists of import to anyone who has ever craved Scotch and/or forks.  Amy is twice registered, and a licensed wood carver in the state of Seattle.  The plaque above is a Christmas gift circa 1978, depicting her skill and large shoe size (10).  She since has developed HCT (Hypochondriacal Carpal Tunnel) and now only carves Spreadable Philly &reg;.  You'll get years of enjoyment out of your Amy.

Pat Anderson in my hometown of Chicago has developed a repository for one of the world's great secrets. It is the <a href="http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~pfa/bald.html">Bald is Beautiful</a> homepage. (See, Patrick Stewart and I <i>do</i> have something in common.)
<p>
Despite the loss of Pea Boy, David Letterman is still god of the after-hours airwaves. 
<br>Pay homage to him at <A HREF = "http://www.access.digex.net/~trow/">Sue Trowbridge's</A> awesome page, or at Aaron Barnhart's weekly <A HREF = "http://www.mcs.net/~barnhart">Late Show News</A>. But if you meet him before I do, ask him what the hell he was thinking with Tom Snyder.
<p>
And for those other nagging television-related needs, many doctors now recommend <A HREF ="http://TVnet.com/TVnet.html">TVnet</A> and especially the soothing <A HREF="http://web3.starwave.com/showbiz/">Mr. Showbiz</A>.
<p>
<A HREF = "http://www.halcyon.com/mcphee/welcome.html">Archie McPhee</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~telford/pez.html">Pez</A> have sites. Now go back to your homes; everything is all right with the world.
<p>
<A HREF = "http://www.discovery.com">The Discovery Channel.</a> Ooh...

I'll have more soon, but right now I have to pee.
