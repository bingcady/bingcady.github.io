<h2>The First Few Letters:</h2>
<h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
<dl>When I thought to write to Dave, I had no idea what a difficult undertaking it would become. First of all, you have to have a purpose for writing. Well, that's what I was told. Also, I was advised, you should know who else might read the letter and their sensitivity to certain word sounds, so you don't offend them.
<p>
I spent nearly a day deciding why I was writing to Dave, and came up with three valid reasons:
<p>
<ol>
<li>I was 20 years old, and had less to do with my life than the Bradys
<li>I wanted to be able to claim Dave as a personal friend on my Friends and Family&reg; account
<li>I wanted to be Dave's head writer (this I'll get to later)
</ol>
<p>
The part about other readers I ignored, figuring if other viewers were like me, they wouldn't have the energy to come find me even if I <i>had</i> offended them.
<p>
Once I determined my motivation, I had the fodder for my first few letters. I felt that, unlike many who wrote to Dave, I should begin our friendship on a more formal note. Therefore the first few, as you'll see, appear somewhat uncertain and strained. I feel, however, that they offer a good introduction to Mr. Entertainment.
