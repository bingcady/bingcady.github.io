Like many Cadys, we can trace our Cady lineage back only to Nicholas Cady (1615-1710). Though we have no certain proof of his background prior to arriving in this country, he came to America (probably from County Suffolk in England) some time prior to 1645. He married Judith Knapp, and they had eight children, the last of which was my ancestor Joseph Cady.
