<blockquote>
<H3>Research </H3>
A Spoon-testing plant, mid-day. The tension is so thick, you could read a newspaper with it. Clyde the headtester is seated at table #1. In front of him (on the table) is a plate of linguine, a bowl of split-pea, and Acme Utensil's latest invention: the whiffle spoon.<p>
Made of durable lightweight plastic, the whiffle spoon sports four pea-sized holes, in the bowl. It is touted as the ultimate calorie saver.<p>
Clyde lifts the spoon, elegantly, slowly, respecting its awesome power. Ploosh. It dips into the soup. Shloop. It rebounds toward Clyde's mouth. Four peas plug the holes. Clyde gets a spoonful of soup. What a terrible disaster.
