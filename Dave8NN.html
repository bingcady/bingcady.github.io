<h2>Phase IV: Resolution With Dave</h2>

By this time, Dave and I were like old friends. Or would be. Gone were the days of petty jealousy over our respective careers. Gone were the sandwiches I made the day I wrote my first letter. Gone even were the voices I heard occasionally calling to me to "break into a bank and paste all the money onto the outside of the bank, for a joke." Dave and I were pals.
<p>
Or would be. Our mutual respect had grown such that neither of us ever felt the need to call the other one a "weasely wimp", or to draw moustaches on newspaper photos of the other one. We had an amicability that transcended all that. 
<p>
What I now felt for Dave was a sincere desire to help him, to offer some fatherly advice now and then, to chide him once in a while for some bonehead slip he made, to play a joke on him occasionally. In short, I began to think of Dave once again as the guy on TV that I used to yell at and throw wet pasta noodles at until the screen, and thus his face, were a complete mess. Our relationship had come full circle.	Or would have.

     Dear Dave:

     Ha, I caught you, you old bugger! I saw
     you the other night when President 
     Bush was on. You called his wife Millie.
     Millie! Right to her face. It didn't look
     like any of the three of you caught on. 
     Millie's the dog! Her name's something
     else. I saw Shaffer come up to you 
     mouthing the words, "It's not Millie, it's 
     Billy!" You oughta think about replacing
     him. What's Ed MacMahon doing? I know 
     a guy who works for that sweepstakes 
     company; he could hook you two up. 
     Think about it.

                    Your bud,

     Dave:

     I've got a line on the Belmont race this
     Thursday. Now don't ask where I got it 
     from, but a guy named Larry Fanters
     told me that Bundle of Gumballs is
     gonna place dead last in the fourth race. 
     Dead last, you got it? I'm laying down 
     everything I've got on this one, that's
     how sure I am.

                    Whatdya say, Dave?

     Dave:

     Here's one for you. Scientists in New 
     Brunswick studying fictional cultures
     have determined that the yellow brick
     road was actually a bright blue. 
     However, the horse of a different color
     really was a different color.

                    Just a little fact,

     Dear Dave:

     I've actually done research on FDR,
     and he really had no problem color-
     coordinating his clothing. But since
     everything was in black-and-white
     back then, it probably wasn't that 
     great a feat.

                    Yours Truly,

     Dear Dave:

     I am the real owner of the Brooklyn 
     Bridge, and I'm looking to unload it.
     You seem like a nice guy, and a 
     shrewd businessman.

     Dave:

     If you're going to diet, don't go with
     one of those silly Hollywood fads.
     Here's what you do:

     ¥ morning: have half a grape, and 
        make a slice of toast but don't
        eat it.

     ¥ lunch: drink just the Cola that 
        sits in that little trough around 
        the rim, and run until you drop
        down and wretch.

     ¥ evening: eat for 20 men, then
        push more food down. 

     ¥ just before bed: light a candle,
        and set it on your scale.

     I've followed this very same regimen
     for twenty years, and never set my
     scale on fire.

     Dave:

     If someone offered you peace of mind, 
     would you take it? I would, but I'm 
     afraid it would plague me. What if 
     someone else needed that comfort, 
     and I took it instead? What if peace
     of mind was just another way of 
     avoiding the real world? What if, by
     choosing eternal harmony, I disqual-
     ified myself from appearing on
     Highway to Heaven? I love that show. 

                    Help me, Dave!

     Dave:

     Danny was a little boy, but not so 
     little that he couldn't unit price. 
     Danny came from a small town in 
     Vermont named GushingBlood. The 
     town had been named by his grand-
     father when he arrived in 1916 
     and stubbed his toe on a mountain.

     Dear Dave:

     I have a Kenmore washer, which has
     satisfactorily served me for more than 
     ten years. My mother and father relied 
     on Kenmore products, and their parents 
     would have done the same had the 
     company existed. But the other day, I
     washed a car tire in that machine, 
     and it stopped cold after only fifteen 
     minutes. Now you and both know that 
     tire isn't clean after only fifteen 
     minutes. I want to think well of 
     Kenmore products and to continue to
     purchase them. But this recent incident
     has upset me, and I wanted to let you 
     know that.

     Dave:

     It's been a good summer. I left the 
     grocery in May to find myself. They
     weren't treating me right, and I
     wasn't growing there. I got a job as
     a butler for some people who had won 
     the lottery, and I really liked them. 
     Of course I did some writing. And 
     golfing. I finally got that wedge to 
     work for me (I tried that hip thing 
     you said to do - works like a charm!)
     Are you and Betty still together? 
     How is your prostate replacement
     working? We've really got to go 
     dancing when we're in the Big Apple      
     sometime. Jane's been watching
     Hammer, so you'd best bone up on
     your box step! I've got to go; Jane's 
     motioning for me to build her a house.

                    Write soon, buddy
