<H2>Fish Day Arriveth</H2>
It is here! Fish Day has arrived in all its wriggling glory. And though we haven't had the time to put together a proper Web tribute, we here at the Art & Architecture Library are reveling enough for all.
<p> 
For the Fish Day newcomer, Fish Day is a celebration of the fish and all it has brought us. For one day each year, we give thanks to the fish, refrain from eating our fine two-gilled friends, and sprinkle fish food in our toilets, for luck. We share stories of fish, and lies and lore; we make stickers from label paper with fish pictures and goofy fish quotes on them; we make cookies, not of fish but shaped like them. And we marvel at a world made slipperier by their presence.
<p>
I will soon put together a Web summary of the day's events. For now, view these lovely fish sites, ponder the meaning of fishdom, and be sure to sprinkle the fish food.

Fish man, now <i>they're</i> cool.
