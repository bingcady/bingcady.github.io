The CIOweb project was begun to serve two purposes. First, the University of Michigan Chief Information Officer needed a departmental site. The new CIO had grand schemes for uniting the various information technology (IT) units around campus into a federation. A first step was to create a symbolic home for this unification.  Goal number two was to provide the world a showcase of what the U-M had done, and could do, at the bleeding edge of technology.
<p>
Though I was already committed full-time to other Web projects, I was able to participate in the initial development of the site, and in the achievement of at least the first of the CIO's goals.
<p>
The team consisted of three members of the CIO staff (one a graphic designer), another designer, and myself. I filled the roles of information architecture and usability consultant, and of technical coordinator and coder.
<p>
The site was built with modularity in mind. With a very short time frame for development, we had to take shortcuts in infrastructure which could be rectified later, but with no alteration apparent to the visitor. What would become a database of U-M IT projects was hard-coded as individual pages. A relatively complex graphic design was translated to the Web via a highly-heirarchical table structure, with a plan for simplifying later. The showcase element of the site was hinted at in the current site, though due to its difference in audience from the departmental site, I assumed a new site would be created to fulfill that goal.
<p>
Though none of the team members had a significant percentage of their time dedicated to the project, we achieved the unveiling in just over 2 months. The site has been well received, and work continues in its evolution.
