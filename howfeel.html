<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">"How do I feel?"
<P>
The question was posed to me only yesterday, and I admit I have been unable to halt contemplation of it since. I laid awake utterly through the dawn in pondering its deceptive simplicity, an epic conundrum thumbing its ineffable nose toward my helpless person. 
<P>
It is only now, after 2 Snickers bars and a Ginseng pill, that I feel sufficiently informed to address it on this page.

<FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Many people would answer this question of well-being with a ranking of between 1 and 10. Responses inspired by the motion picture "Spinal Tap" aside, such linearity inevitably fails to take into account the 3rd dimension. 6 is fine, yet how thickly do we feel 6? How deep is our perception of 3, how engaged are we in our 4-ness? Do you see?

The Zen master would at this point say to me, "I have not the respect of your answer to pee upon it." This is why I don't like Zen. Don't get me any Zen books; it'll only make me angry.
<P>
For those who <EM>do </EM> have the respect to pee on it, here is what I think I was trying to say by my little triplet. I think, upon reflection, that I was pointing up three basic ideas:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> the Taoist notion of needing to directly experience reality in order to understand it, 
<LI> the urge of many to deny what they feel, however painful it may be, and 
<LI> the utter pointlessness of trying to navigate the <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?Pyt=Tmap&YY=4179&addr=division%20and%20packard&city=Ann%20Arbor&state=MI&slt=42.2744&sln=-83.7443&mag=8&cs=7&newmag=9">Division/Packard area</a>. 
</UL>
<P>
Some have called these notions ridiculous, but many of them do not own a car.

The riddle certainly addresses the physical and emotional state of my being; however, there is in it a noticeable lack of consideration with respect to the intellectual sphere. For this, I must turn to a quote made famous by Samuel Longhorne Clemens, better known as 'Twiggy':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Socrates once said that he knew that he knew nothing. If I knew that, I certainly wouldn't admit it."

<P>
I have always admired that lack of confidence in one's own ignorance, and I strive to embody it daily. Long live Twiggy!

In summary, then, I find myself fairly proud of the ability to express in 43 words and a handful of punctuation that which it would take others a single digit to express. I might add that it is my earnest hope that the makers of the peanut butter and jelly swirled together in a jar may someday find the strength to do the same with mayonnaise and haggis.
