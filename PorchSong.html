Myth: F&uuml;r Elise was originally an old Etruscan bed-wetting ditty.<p>
Fact:	Fur Elise was not written by the Etruscans at all, as they were too busy making combs. The song was actually penned in 1963 by a lady from Twelve-Lakes-and-a-Tree, Michigan who had several encounters with UFOs. 
<p>
According to Mrs. Ella Fitzgood, she was washing dishes and watching Sid Caesar reruns when suddenly out on the roof there arose such a clatter. She went outside to see what was wrong, and spied two tiny spores that looked like dandelion seeds approaching her, drifting slowly as though carried by the wind. 
<p>
She remembers touching one of them, and she felt what she described as a 'nothing' sort of feeling. The other spore continued on past her, seeming not to notice her. But the spore she had touched wafted gently up Ella's suburban middle-class married nose, and caused her to sneeze. According to neighbors who were drinking but not heavily or in a slovenly manner, Mrs. Fitzgood went into a sneezing fit in which she played not only Fur Elise in several different chords, but also "Mine Eyes Have Seen The Glory", the soundtrack from the movie <I>Spaceballs</I>, the MC Hammer catalogue, and "Pomp and Circumstance" (all the way through). 
<p>
One magazine story took the opportunity to interview other songwriters of the time: John Phillips Sousa called Ella Fitzgood "the father of 20th century American music". Paul Simon said she was full of crap.
