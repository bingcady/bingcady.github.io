We at Temperature Plus have been listening to you. You said you needed something a little warm to the touch, and we gave you tepid. Then you challenged us to do better, and we responded with hot. But a few of you weren't satisfied even with that. So for you, we present sweltering. Sweltering; it's warmer than you think. Sweltering. From the makers of lukewarm.
