Ten people wait on a dock. 3 are waiting for a ship. One is waiting for Our Lord, who is waiting for him impatiently in an airport miles from here. 5 people are waiting for the mood to strike them. The other 2 aren't actually there, but asked that I mention them.<p>
A ship pulls up to the dock. Out jumps a woman dressed in nothing but a t-shirt, jeans, 2 socks, a pair of sneakers, a sweater, a baseball cap, and a light windbreaker. And a bracelet. All heads turn and fix upon the woman. She pretends not to notice.<p>
"Hey," she calls. "Someone look at me."<p> 
All ten people continue to stare intently.<p> 
"Come on. Just a little look."<p> 
No change.<p> 
"Aw, forget it" she sighs, and explodes into a ball of flames.<p> 
"Did you see that?" asks the person who is awaiting Jesus.<p> 
One of the 2 who isn't there says, "Yah. She's done that twice already today. I don't know where she gets the energy; if I had exploded once I'd need a nap."<p> 
"She's a professional" confides another person, having known her from grad school.<p> 
"Oh," says the first. "Where the hell is our Savior?"<p> 
A passing monk decides to answer the call. "He died. Didn't you know?"<p> 
"Yah, yah, semantics," says the waiter. "He could call if He's going to be late."<p> 
"That's true" says the monk.<p> 
The ship departs the dock, having unloaded the exploded woman's luggage.<BR> 
"Hey, someone look at me" cries the luggage.<p>
An hour passes. All the people are still there, except the two who were never there in the first place. But no one seems to notice their absence.<p> 
"You're waiting for a ship too?" asks one of the people who is waiting for a ship to another person who is waiting for a ship.<p> 
"I can't remember" says the ship waiter.<p> 
"You know, that was a ship that dropped the woman off," mentions the messiah waiter.<p> 
"Yah, but I'm waiting for a blue ship, something lightweight" explains ship waiter 1.<p> 
"I like orange" says ship waiter 2, "And heavy."<p> 
The mood strikes the 5 people, and they leave.<p> 
"Lucky stiffs," complains the man waiting for the Nazarene. "We're gonna be here all night."<p>
After 3 more hours of people waiting and saying things, the man who has faithfully waited for the man who was born in a barn, founded a religion and then got crucified 1900-odd years ago speaks up.<p>
"I can't wait anymore" says Jerry (that's his name). "I have kids to feed." (Jerry owns a goat farm, but normally keeps that to himself). "JC can drive his own damned self home."<p>
<IMG  Align=Right SRC="Boat.GIF">
"Yah, I'd better go home too." says ship waiter 1. "It's so dark now that if a ship did arrive, I'd never be able tell its color."<p> 
"Or its weight." adds ship waiter 2.<p>
Everyone leaves, and the dock is once again empty.<p>
But somewhere in an airport luggage pickup area, a major deity is getting really pissed.
