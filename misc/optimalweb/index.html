<h3>Optimizing the Web for Knowledge Acquisition</h3>
</center>

[These are all just very quick thoughts; definitely rewrite this whole thing]
<p>
<font size=+2><b>W</b></font>elcome! This is just the very start of thought on a problem that's been gnawing at me for 3 years now. I finally had to put it down and see if somebody else had thoughts to contribute, resources I should look at, etc. (If you send ideas or URLs to me and it seems like they'd help the discussion, I'll add them and be sure to credit you.) 
<p>
Obviously, the problem is huge. By no means do I hope to solve it here, only to look at and spur on ideas for combining the various independent areas of study into more integrated solutions. 
I'm admittedly a bit out of my league on this, but if I can even begin the effort and leave it to others to continue, I'd be quite happy. 
<p>
I've tried to write this in a more relaxed style than the normal academic prose manner, so as to make this material as approachable and inviting to as many people as possible. I'm just looking for all sorts of ideas, so please don't be shy about adding your thoughts.
<p>
Thanks for helping with this effort!

<center><b>The Problem Statement</b></center>
<p>
How to optimize this Web environment to provide the most efficient and enjoyable knowledge acquisition experience possible.


<p>
<center><b>Notes (flush these out before announcing this page)</b></center>
<p>
<ul>
<li>By "acquiring knowledge", I mean all information assimilation, not just pure development of skills or integration of difficult concepts. The act of finding out the hours of a library is as much an act of acquiring knowledge as grasping the overhand volleyball serve. Many people would use the term "information retrieval" to describe this process, but I want to cover not only the act of getting to the information but also the mental acquisition of the knowledge therein. For example, though good navigation may lead one to an article on pruning bonsai, slow load times (an extra long page), an unreadable typeface, certain colors of type, complex background images, overly long line length, hyper-technical terminology, etc. can inhibit the user's ability to grasp the knowledge easily. It can be done, but we need to make it <b>very</b> easy.
<p>
<li>My attention problems (and links to ADD and other resources) as the cause of my interest
<p>
<li>Usability testing as the main key (because each site and audience is different); don't imagine what your users want; ask them! (But also provide links to known studies, so people can see protocols and possibilities and also start to see occasional patterns of findings)
<p>
<li>Richard Saul Wurman and graphical/organizational systems for easing concept understanding
<p>
<li>User interface theories (screen readability, "eye anchors", browsing methods, etc.)
<p>
<li>Lynda Weinman's bandwidth-saving graphic ideas
<p>
<li>Argus Associates' information architecture theories
<p>
<li>Jennifer Fleming's Web navigation ideas, and other experimental navigation methods
<p>
<li>Cornix speed-text reader and other assistive technologies
<p>
<li>Today's predominant educational theories
<p>
<li>Experimental multimedia and distance learning projects for case studies
<p>
<li>Sensible uses of personalization to accomodate different levels of familiarity with the subject, learning styles, intelligences (Garner's Multiple Intelligences theories), attention span, level of subject interest, age group, Meyers-Briggs style, etc. (For example, provide 10 different proven methods of explaining the calculus concept of limits. The system chooses the most appropriate method based on the user's stated learning style, etc. Then if the user doesn't learn it fully using that method, s/he can view each remaining explanation. The totality of the distinct ways of explanation may prove helpful in seeing the concept from many angles.)
<p>
<li>True maximization of hypertext methods to compartmentalize information into bite-sized chunks (drill-down), and the ideas of cumulative learning, quick and easy exercises to assist knowledge assimilation, and spontaneous (ungraded) testing to help users get their arms around and then retain difficult concepts or large amounts of related information
<p>
<li>Definitely provide little working models of ideas wherever appropriate.
<p>
<li>Links to books, articles, Web sites, etc.
</ul>
<p>
How does the interaction of any 2 or more of these methods affect the outcome. Where are the balances? What tradeoffs exist (the Web publishing process is filled with tradeoffs)? How does all this and more fit together to provide the ideal online learning environment?
