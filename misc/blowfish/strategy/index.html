<h3>Minor Variation on Our Vball Strategy</h3>

This is a strategy some of the more experienced players <br>
on our Men's B team have taught us. We used it Monday; <br>
it seems pretty easy to learn and has some advantages.

<table border="0" cellpadding="20">
	<tr valign=top align=left>
		<td>
		<font face="verdana, arial" size="-1">
		<img src="servereceive.sm.gif" width="207" height="352"><p>
		This position is the same as our normal one. 
		The front row covers any short serves. 
		The back row plays with the middle 
		player up and the wing players back. 
		</font>
		</td>
		
		<td>
		<font face="verdana, arial" size="-1">
		<img src="serve.sm.gif" width="207" height="352"><p>
		In this position, the front row players are up at the net to block. 
		The middle back row player has moved back and covers the entire back line.
		The wings of the back row move up to receive hits and cover any dinks. 
		</font>
		</td>
		
		<td>
		<font face="verdana, arial" size="-1">
		<img src="playyourside.sm.gif" width="207" height="352"><p>
		During a play, whenever the ball has come over to our side 
		of the net and has been dug, the front row wing players move back, 
		so as to be able to adjust for any setting errors and to get a 
		running jump for their hit.
