A few years ago, I was nominated to the small and select list of Proud Bald Men on the Web (see the <a href="http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/~pfa/bald.html">Bald Is Beautiful</a> homepage). 
<p>
I have been bald since the age of 21 (over a decade of comb-free living and counting), and I have no intention of not being bald anytime soon. 
<p>
If you would prefer I grow hair, you're going to have to pay me a lot of money, and invent some miracle cure. If, on the other hand, you revel in my near-abject hairlessness or are simply indifferent to the whole thing, you check out these fine links:

I am not completely bald as of today (the day isn't that long), but for the right woman I will take it all off.
