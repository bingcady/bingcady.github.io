<center><h2>John and Amy's 70s-esque Memories</h2></center>

<font size=+2>A</font>my and I have seen the current trend towards retroization of the decade that was the 1970s, and we are appalled at the liberty taken with the truth of those times. Though we grew up in cities halfway across two states (and Amy lived practically on a farm), we nonetheless both experienced this period firsthand, and we know a romanticized marketing sham when we see one.
<p>
So here is our remembrance of the products, shows, and people that made the 70s an era to forget...uh, remember.

<b>Mild Disclaimer:</b> No, John and Amy are not going out. Amy has better taste than that.

(alternate Disclaimer: No, John and Amy are not going out. Amy is happily married, and John is too weird for most people.)
