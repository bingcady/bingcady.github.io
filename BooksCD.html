Editing Disclaimer: As you'll be able to tell, I did not follow many of the standard editing rules when writing these books. Some of it was due to disagreements I have with the rules (which I do follow in my other writing work, for those of you who might hire me), but much of it was done to maximize the humor. And I'll fight any grammarian who wants to challenge me.
