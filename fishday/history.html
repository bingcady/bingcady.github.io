The fish we know today are quiet, enigmatic, even aloof. There is something
mysterious about these limbless creatures, an answer which the knowledge we
had heretofore gained about them could not provide. But what we haven't known
until quite recently are the details of their long evolutionary climb, and the
secret life they live today.
<p>
We owe nearly all of this newly-acquired knowledge to <a href="flortan.html">Dr. 
Edward Flortan</a>, who lived with a largish group of bluegills for
nearly 10 years. In those years, he not only set the Guinness record for
holding one's breath (and won several TV endorsements for wrinkled skin
products), but he also brought the true story of fish to the world.

<h3>Enter the Fish</h3>

The first fish was born in 153 million B.C., to a proud prehistoric snake and
a particularly attractive piece of coral. Prior to this individual (let's call
her Victoria Louise de la Parra y Lordes), marine animals had not bothered to
take advantage of the liquidy medium in which they lived. The single-celled
organisms that began Earth's race to the Edsel (and their successors) mostly
sat on the ocean floor and contemplated their lack of taxation.
<p>
But, thanks in no small part to Charles Darwin's discovery, then came Victoria
Louise de la Parra y Lordes. A corally/snake-like young woman, she was
nonetheless endowed with a pair of wiggling fins. At first, she was ignorant
of her great gift; but one fateful day, she found a use. 
<p>
Unlike other snakes who constantly derided each other in an aimless sort of
way, Victoria Louise de la Parra y Lordes realized that she could point at
particular snakes when mocking at them. The snakes, who were unused to knowing
it was they who were being made fun of, suddenly found they could slither.
They took to this slithering quickly, and came speeding at Victoria Louise de
la Parra y Lordes, who was unable to slither, owing to her stiff coral
heritage. Certain death was imminent, and Victoria Louise de la Parra y Lordes
saw her brief life flash before her primitive precursors to eyes. She made a
desperate attempt with her fins to pray, but she could not join them. Again
she tried, and again, and again. 
<p>
Suddenly, she felt herself rising up. She kept trying to pray, and soon, she
had left the mock-worthy snakes far below. Perhaps only the Wright Brothers
could know the feeling Victoria Louise de la Parra y Lordes felt at that
moment. And they'd had to sit in uncomfortable seats to know it.

<h3>Neanderthals</h3>

Flash forward a hundred and a half million years. Early hominids are making
big strides at becoming fully human. Some stand upright; others kill things
with sticks; still others drag fellow hominids into caves by their hair.
Meanwhile, the adolescent fish has developed a growing communication system
based on subaudible signals. By the ascendancy of Java Man, the fish nation
has a system of broadcasting and 12 hours of daily programming (mostly variety
and talk shows). However, not yet evident is a clear sense of humor. On one of
the more popular shows, an eel slips on a banana, starting a weeklong
discussion on why an eel would do that.

<h3>Swim Like an Eqyptian</h3>

3,000 B.C. It is the time of pharoahs, and silly attempts at writing. A large
percentage of the populace prefers to live in slavery, and they build large
pyramid-shaped buildings because the Egyptian leaders run out of other things
for them to do. 
<P>
Fish at this time have experimented with aristocracy, and decide that a vote
of all fish keeps the complaining to a minimum. At first they elect a leader
fish, but after a number of scandals involving breaches of their concept of
monogamy, they decide to vote on every issue themselves. The collective
ponderings of such issues begins to restrict fish free time, and most of their
fish shenanigans wane in popularity. 

<h3>Colonial Days</h3>

1780. The American Founding Fathers are busy creating a new form of
government. Benjamin Franklin starts the post office and library. Thomas
Jefferson does a bunch of things we can't even recall right now. And after
having lied about a cherry tree and throwing currency across a river, George
Washington keeps trying to retire, but is thwarted repeatedly.
<P>
In the fish world, things are happening too. In the intervening years, fish
have spent so much time thinking about the many governmental referenda that
their minds have developed considerably. They've built an extensive
philosophy, new understandings of science and mathematics, and a well-honed
sense of humor. Now when an eel (or a barracuda or a pike) slips on a banana,
every fish laughs uncontrollably. 

<h3>Today</h3>

As we approach the turn of the millennium, humanity has made great strides in
technology, medicine, and the sculpting of large blocks of ice for parties.
But we have quite a ways to go to catch up with our scaly friends. Fish
society is now more developed than ever, and they have found ways to end fish
crime, fish hunger, and fish ineptness around celebrities. 
So advanced are they now that the human operators of the more respected
psychic hotlines get their information straight from the fishes' mouths. Some
of us know when we're licked intellectually.

<h3>The End of a Tale (Tail?)</h3>

So this much we now know. With this knowledge, perhaps we can work to improve
our treatment of and relations with these things we call fish. Still, we have
a way to go to dispel our long-held fish <a href="myths.html">myths</a>.
