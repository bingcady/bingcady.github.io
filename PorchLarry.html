<H3>Get yer fresh bowling balls!</H3>
Haven't you ever wanted to hurl a fresh cantaloupe down the lanes? Well then try our new Earl Anthony Series Cantaloupe&reg; hurlers. They look and smell just like real cantaloupes, but you can bowl with them. And what's more, they never go bad.<p>
How about serving up a Honey Dew volleyball? There's nothing like a citrus slam to weaken your opponents' resolve. Our Navel Orange baseballs are a winner with the kids, and they're non-toxic and unpeelable. And Nectarine golf balls make a hit on any course. If you lose your ball, just follow the scent of ripe, luscious nectarines!<p>
Try out our complete line of sporting equipment. Each comes with its very own supply of appropriate juice. So next time you hit a Grapefruit softball and give your friends a faceful of juice, you can tell them it's Fresh Fruit&reg; juice.<p>
Fresh Fruit Sports Equipment. We're always in season.
