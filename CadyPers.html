<H2>Personal Background/Career Orientation</H2>

<blockquote>
I grew up in the Chicago area and gained my post-secondary education first at Knox 
College in Illinois and then at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Since 
graduation, I've worked fulltime as the Circulation Supervisor of the University of 
Michigan's Art & Architecture Library. Here I gained not only management and training 
skills, but also became exposed to other influences. The Library's shared space with 
a campus computing site provided me the opportunity to develop a wide range of 
computing skills on several platforms. As well, the artistic influences of the 
Library's patrons sensitized me to the nuances of graphic design and piqued my 
interest in desktop publishing.
<p>
I have since 1992 pursued various freelance writing and editing projects for a 
number of local and national clients. I have written editorial, humorous, critical, 
promotional, and technical pieces, and I have developed longstanding professional 
relationships with my employers. 
<p>
My freelance work a few years ago first exposed me to the world of technical writing. 
I since have produced training and user manuals, specifications sheets, and short 
software documentation. I have recently had the opportunity to work in the Windows 
environment developing online help documentation for a decision support software 
package. 
<p>
I am very interested in the area of software documentation, both in its printed forms
and in online implementations. I feel that the face of documentation will change in 
significant and exciting ways in the near future as economic pressures, the public's
increasing computer sophistication, and emerging technologies create new needs and 
capabilities. I would very much like to move into fulltime employment in the software
documentation field, preferably with a firm located in the midwest.
<p>
I believe that the strengths I could bring to such a firm include: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>an aptitude for logical and efficient organization of materials
<p>
<li>the ability to communicate difficult concepts clearly
<p>
<li>a background of formal and informal training of a wide variety of students in 
various software applications
<p>
<li>the ability to learn technical concepts quickly and to apply that knowledge effectively
<p>
<li>accuracy with detailed editing work
<p>
<li>equal facility in operating independently and in a teammember capacity
<p>
<li>a strong willingness to adapt to the environment, personalities, and demands of the job
<p>
<li>experience working effectively with a range of collaborators and clients, from 
engineers and documentation specialists, to librarians and nontechnical writers and 
editors, to interview subjects and the general nontechnical public
<p>
<li>a rooted understanding of various desktop publishing packages and of the principles 
of effective design
<p>
<li>familiarity with online authoring systems, including html and Windows help 
authoring packages
<p>
<li>a strong commitment to excellence
<p>
and
<li>a firm dedication to constant self-improvement and the development of new skills
</ul>
<p>
I feel that I can provide the timeliness, quality, and professional personality needed 
in today's documentation environment, and I would welcome the opportunity to discuss
job possibilities with any interested parties.
