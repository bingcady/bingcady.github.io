<h2>Phase III: The Adolescence of My Writing</h2>

<h3>Pushing the Envelope</h3>

Relationships develop over time, and often seem to wax and wane in their enthusiasm. I'll admit that at some point, I began to get a little edgy with Dave. I can't say whether it was the sideburns chafing me, or the fact that watching Dave one night cost me a chance at winning a lovely set of dish towels at the local summer fair (I was told an old woman won them, and didn't even hit the bullseye that squarely). It was one of those two incidents, though, that peeved me, and I guess I got a little carried away. 
<p>
Dave, for his part, wasn't exactly guilt-free however. I was in the bathroom soaking my head (like my girlfriend told me to do) one night, when I believe I heard Dave say something to the effect of, "Cady, you're such a weasely wimp letting your girlfriend order you around like that" during his monologue. That's not funny. I hadn't yet said anything to him. He was just baiting me.
<p>
Therefore, I began to send him letters with a little more meat to them. Something he might not read but one of his letter-opening college interns would, and then they'd share it with the others in the office and titter as Dave walked by and perhaps start stealing one of his shoes right before airtime or something. It was indirect, but would be effective nonetheless. I don't know if Dave ever read one of thse letters - wait, actually I do. He didn't, because I never sent them. That's right.

<h3>The Letters</h3>

     Tell me Dave (you're an insider):

     How come guys like Pauly Shore and John 
     Cortese and that stupid drum-playing
     rabbit get to be on TV, when everybody
     knows they have no talent and are 
     irritating as hell. I can be irritating, 
     Dave, and if I have any talents to speak
     of, I certainly haven't found them yet.
     Maybe I could be a big star. I could do
     ads in a mall flinging condoms at
     couples. I could wander into public 
     restrooms with a jar of Metamucil and
     yell into stalls, "Still going. Nothing
     outlasts Metamucil." I could berate 
     older women for not wearing Depends.
     Believe me, Dave, I can be annoying.

                    Yours Truly,
                    John

     Dear Dave:

     Someone told me you sell your old clothes
     to a wax museum, and they cover the Rick
     Moranis dummies with them. Tell me this 
     isn't true. I have so much respect for Mr.
     Moranis.

                    Your Truly,

     Geez Dave:

     There are a number of things I want to 
     say. First of all, the NBC commissary
     is a fine establishment, and I'm tired of
     you picking on it.Secondly, where is it 
     written that just because you have a 
     rash, you can't do gardening work for 
     other people?

                    Your Truly,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI

<b>I never liked to get mad at Dave. But just like when I found out that Calvert DeForest is really a brand of lime sherbert, I could get quite miffed about being played for a fool.</b>
<p>
<pre>
     Dear Dave:

     I met a guy the other day who says it's 
     fake when you throw your pencil through
     the window. Is it fake when you pick up
     your paycheck? Come on, Dave; you can 
     spring for real glass.

                    Your Truly,
                    John Cady

<b>To get ideas for more letters to Dave, I began to study what other people had written in. After a while, it became apparent to me that the letters were mostly written in jest - joke letters, if you will. I decided to try my hand at the joke letter.</b>
<p>
<pre>
     Hey Dave:

     Boy, have you got a big nose.

                    Yours Truly,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI

<b>For whatever reason, I soon gave up on the joke letters and went back to developing my relationship in earnest.</b>

     Dear Dave:

     On a recent show, I heard you say you'd 
     fight the whole audience. I'll fight you, 
     Dave. 4:30 tomorrow, by the big oak
     tree. Or are you scared?

                   Your Truly,
                   John Cady

<b>My temper eventually relaxed. I came to realize it wasn't really Dave's fault that he didn't reply; I could have done my part and sent the letters. I gave up the Dave-taunting, but not before experimenting briefly with psychological torture methods.</b>
<p>
<pre>
     Dear Dave:

     Guess who I am (I'm doing an impression 
     of you right now). Guess who I am.

                    Yours Truly,
                    John Cady

<b>Just one of those existential head games. Indulge me.</b>
<p>
<pre> </pre>
<p>
<b>By now, I had been watching Dave for quite a while. I had noticed, a while back, that his life seemed to lack excitement apart from the show. He was complaining a lot about it in his monologue now, so I decided I could think of some fun things for him to do. </b>
<p>
<pre>
     Dear Dave:

     Have you ever hollowed out a television 
     set, called a repair technician, then 
     hidden inside the TV and talked to him
     when he comes? Being that you actually
     have a TV show, you might be able to 
     pull it off.

                    Your Truly,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI

<b>I tried another angle, too, in case it was public recognition he found himself lacking.</b>
<p>

     Dave:

     Do you ever get jealous that Paul Newman 
     has his face on food packages? I've often
     thought that your likeness could grace a 
     product. I have a friend who does 
     marketing for Silly Putty. They couldn't
     pay much, but it would be exposure.

                    Your Truly,
                    John Cady

     Dave:

     Do this; go into a greek restaurant, ask
     for the head waiter. Make a big deal 
     about seeing the head waiter, say you'll 
     order from no one else. When he comes, 
     say, "I'll have the BLT."

                    Yours Truly,
                    John Cady

     Dave:

     I've got an idea: we get a whole bunch of
     those sweet pickles, the midgets, and
     we find a huge jar, and we put the 
     pickles in the jar and sell them as jar
     fillings.

                    Yours Truly,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI

     Dave:

     All right, all right. I've got it: a show 
     based on the old Mannix series, but
     instead of you being the detective, 
     you're an ice fisherman in Costa Rica.
     And the gimmick is, you never do catch
     any ice. I've got a script already started. 
     Let me know, Dave. 

                    Yours Truly,
                    John Cady

     Dear Dave:

     My guess is 52 beans. If I am right, 
     please send my winnings to the address
     below.

                    Thank you (and godspeed),
