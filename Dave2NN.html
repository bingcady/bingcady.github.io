<h2>The First Few Letters:</h2>
<h3>The Journey Begins</h3>
<dl>When I thought to write to Dave, I had no idea what a difficult undertaking it would become. First of all, you have to have a purpose for writing. Well, that's what I was told. Also, I was advised, you should know who else might read the letter and their sensitivity to certain word sounds, so you don't offend them.
<p>
I spent nearly a day deciding why I was writing to Dave, and came up with three valid reasons:
<p>
<ol>
<li>I was 20 years old, and had less to do with my life than the Bradys
<li>I wanted to be able to claim Dave as a personal friend on my Friends and Family&reg; account
<li>I wanted to be Dave's head writer (this I'll get to later)
</ol>
<p>
The part about other readers I ignored, figuring if other viewers were like me, they wouldn't have the energy to come find me even if I <i>had</i> offended them.
<p>
Once I determined my motivation, I had the fodder for my first few letters. I felt that, unlike many who wrote to Dave, I should begin our friendship on a more formal note. Therefore the first few, as you'll see, appear somewhat uncertain and strained. I feel, however, that they offer a good introduction to Mr. Entertainment.

     Dear Dave:

     Hey, aren't you that guy on TV?

                    Yours Truly,

<b>The next three were my alternate attempts at the first letter. In each case, I think it's clear that I'm asking for something.
<br>(I've found it's better to ask someone for things <i>before</i> they get to know you. Especially if you ever plan to insult them.)</b>

     Dear Dave:

     Our having never met, I'm sure you won't 
     remember me. I'm the person who works
     at the bookstore in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
     Hi.

     I don't know if you know this or not, but
     I've been watching you on TV. I was 
     wondering if I could have your show, and
     you could do my bookstore job.

                          Yours Truly,
                          John Cady

     Dear Dave:

     You probably don't remember me, but a 
     few years ago, we met in a restaurant 
     in Manhattan there.  In the confusion, I 
     got your fortune cookie, and I can only 
     think you must have gotten mine.  

     I'd like to know if you still have that 
     cookie, and if we could meet sometime 
     to trade them back.

                          Yours Truly,
                          John Cady

     Dear Dave:

     Let me first say that I love your show. 
     I watch it almost every night, and never 
     miss it unless something else is on or
     I'm cramping up.
     
     I would like you to do me a favor, Dave. 
     I need a considerable amount of money, 
     and I understand that you have way too
     much. What do you say, Dave? For old
     time's sake?

                          Yours Truly,
                          John Cady

<b>This fifth letter was more of a relaxed thing. The introductions having been made, I felt fairly comfortable delving a bit into Dave's personal life. But I wanted him to take it seriously, so I impersonated someone official.</b>

     Let's pretend I'm a reporter from GQ. 
     Where do you live? Hm. Who picks out
     your ties? Not that crazy lady who was           
     stalking you, I hope? Do you own a lot of
     suits? Compared to Imelda Marcos, are
     you more - or less - interested in shoes?
     Who coiffs you? Why do you insist on     
     keeping that space between your teeth?
     If you developed a lot of nose hair,  
     would you have electrolysis or would you
     just shove a razor in your nostril? Do you
     have any good stories about you with 
     famous clothing designers? What does 
     Robin Leach look like in his underwear?
     Who coiffs you? Are those leggy      
     supermodels from the Ford Agency real, 
     or are they - as have been rumored - 
     just airbrushed relatives? Have you seen
     SW1 from "In Living Color"? What's your 
     stance on ears? If you and Cher got in a 
     fight, who would win?

                          John

     PS: Who coiffs you?

<b>Another question session. I wanted to ask him an important question, to show I valued his opinion on the loftier subjects.</b>

     Dave:

     I've just celebrated Rosh Hashanah, but 
     I'm not Jewish. Will God be mad at me?

                    Yours Truly,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI

     PS: Do that thing you do with your leg.
           I love that.

<b>(To be honest, I know of nothing Dave does with his leg. I guess I just wanted to raise his self-consciousness.)</b>

     Dear Dave:

     I've got a problem and Dr. Ruth isn't on 
     right now. The problem happens when I'm
     cooking, Dave. I am whipping the butter,
     just like they say, and the TV will turn on.
     All by itself. So I go lie down for a while.
     When I wake up, the TV is still on, but the
     butter has burned and ruined the pan. What
     do I do, Dave?

                    Sincerely,
                    John Cady

<b>Now I turn to celebrities. See how I'm asking him about the subjects he knows, to keep him comfortable? I read that trick in a book somewhere.</b>

     Dave:

     How many times do you think they've 
     titled a Christie Brinkley photospread
     "Corpus Christie"?

     Dear Dave:

     I was thinking about something puzzling
     the other day. If you stood in a room 1,100
     feet underground wearing ear plugs and a
     helmet made of 3-foot thick insulation,
     would you look like a giant Mr. Microphone?

                    Yours Truly,
                    John Cady

<b>I began thinking after a while that Dave must get sick of everyone asking him questions. Here I think I was sharing a personal fact from my life, to take the pressure off him.</b>
<p>
<pre>
     Dear Dave:

     I just realized something the other day. 
     Food doesn't eat people, it's the other way      
     around. It sounds silly, but since that      
     discovery, I feel a lot more at ease in
     restaurants.

                    There you go,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI

<b>However, from watching Dave on TV, I soon gathered that he did enjoy being asked questions. Wanting to oblige him, I thought of a somewhat obscure question, to challenge him a little.</b>
<p>
<pre>
     Dear Dave:

     I teach kindergarten, and a child asked me  
     an intriguing question the other day. She      
     noted that the traditional heart you see on     
     Valentine's Day and those godawful NY
     bumperstickers is actually shaped nothing
     like a human heart. She asked me why we      
     use this factually-incorrect symbol. I
     explained to her that it looks more like a 
     red butt, but maybe you have a better
     answer.

                    Thanks Dave,
                    John Cady

     Dear Dave:

     I hear that Barry Manilow is trying, once
     again, to make a comeback. Do you plan to     
     make one? I'd sure like to see you back on 
     television.

                    Sincerely,
                    John Cady
                    Ann Arbor, MI
